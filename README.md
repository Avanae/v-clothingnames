# v-clothingnames

GXT entries and human readable names of GTA V clothing items.

Many items have "NO_LABEL" and "NULL" as their names, which probably means they aren't available for purchase in GTA Online clothes shops OR they're old enough to have their names hardcoded in game scripts.

Files without a prefix (e.g. masks.json) are the clothing items for both **mp_m_freemode_01** and **mp_f_freemode_01** models. (aka for SET_PED_COMPONENT_VARIATION)

Files prefixed with **male_** are the clothing items for **mp_m_freemode_01** model. (aka for SET_PED_COMPONENT_VARIATION)

Files prefixed with **female_** are the clothing items for **mp_f_freemode_01** model. (aka for SET_PED_COMPONENT_VARIATION)

Files prefixed with **props_male_** are the props for **mp_m_freemode_01** model. (aka for SET_PED_PROP_INDEX)

Files prefixed with **props_female_** are the props for **mp_f_freemode_01** model. (aka for SET_PED_PROP_INDEX)
